Hi! My name is Darshil Gandhi. I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Financial Technology (MS in FinTech) at the University of South Florida, graduating in December 2026.
This repository is where I post my finance, FinTech, Python, data analysis, and quant-related projects as I continue learning and building my portfolio.
I am actively looking for Summer 2026 internships in roles such as:
Financial Analyst
Risk Analyst / Quant Risk
FinTech Analyst
Data / Quant Intern
Finance + Tech hybrid roles
I’m passionate about bridging finance and technology using tools like Python, machine learning, and financial modeling.
